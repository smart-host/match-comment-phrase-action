# match-comment-phrase-action

## Example usage in a workflow

Your workflow needs to listen to the following events:

```yml
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created, edited]
```

And then you can use the action in your jobs like this:

```yml
jobs:
  preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: smart-host/match-comment-phrase-action@master
        id: check
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'
        with:
          phrase: '/preview'
          reactions: eyes
          mode: starts_line
      - run: 'echo Found it!'
        if: steps.check.outputs.match_found == 'true'
```

Reactions must be one of the reactions here: https://developer.github.com/v3/reactions/#reaction-types
And if you specify a reaction, you have to provide the `GITHUB_TOKEN` env variable.
